# Topic-Modelling-NLP-Capstone-Project
This project explores Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to classify Sports/News headlines.
- Sports headlines will be obtained from the News section of the Bleacher Report and NewYorkTimes websites.
- Top News headlines will be obtained from CNN's 2023 Top news stories page.

The data will be preprocessed through tokenization, lemmatization and stemming before being put into Bag of Words format in order to use for the LDA model.
Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency will also be explored. These techniques will be used to create a sufficient model and then pyLDAvis will be used to visualize the data and interpret the topics formed.
